# Tank Mileage Tracker

[![showpiece](??? img location)](??? link to live website)

Click [here](???) to live site.  

## UX

The app aims to record daily mileage for each journey.

Workflow 1.
App can be used every day for each journey and the driver can save each route as they go. 
  - log in
  - go to "drive"
  - put in start and destination
  - be transfered to map preview page
  - add to database
  - click to go to maps (google maps on mobile or google maps website on desktop)
  - they arrive at destination
  - to go to next location, they need to go back to the Tank website (they would still be on map preview)
  - go back to "drive"
  - put in start and destinaton

This workflow requres too many steps - need to improve on this
This workflow requires the driver to juggle beetween google maps and Tank website and the work app that tells him the next address. 

This workflow makes sure that driver:
  - adds each journey to database (because he puts the address in Tank website instead of google maps) 
  - currently the driver needs to open work app - look up destination address and type postcode to google map.
  - with Tank website he needs to type the address and it allows him quickly to add the journey to database and get transfered to maps

Because the Tank website forces the user to regular use every day during the whole shift - it can be a good platform for:
  - trafficc messages
  - in work messages
  - tracking employer's progres in mileage reporting
  - advertising (if app is to be used commercialy)

Database:
  - each journey is saved as seperate position with start and destination saved with the distance.

Workflow 2
  - if drived didn't put in mileage for a particular day - needs to put in mileage in bulk

Workflow 3 
  - if driver has checked their daily report and realises he forgot to add one destination in the middle of the route. 



### User Stories

+ As a user, I would like to be able to â€¦



1.  the information to be clear and informative;
2.  the website be easy to navigate;


### Wireframes 

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability. 

[Wireframes](???)

## Existing Features 

### Navbar and Footer

+ Navbar and footer has been copied from Bootstrap components and adjusted to the needs of the project
+ Navbar collapses into a hamburger button for easy navigation on mobile devices.
+ 

### Home page 

Traffic alert design - I've chosen a simple card design from bootstrap. I have also chosen to stack up the cards for larger screens to see two beside each other.
Since this is an app for driver I have taken the mobile first aproach. This app needs to be comfortable to use by someone that is using mobile phone only. This led to a decision to display only maximum of 4 messages per page. This way the mobile phone user will not have to scroll down too much, but there is an option to go to the next page.

## Project Bugs and Solutions:

### Problem with displaying form fields using |as_bootstrap

Forms with added |as_bootstrap display neatly on the page, unified with the style of the app. Unfortunately displaying form|as_bootstrap causes that fields display without proper gap between each line. The fields stick too close one above another. The label is nearly touching the field above. 

First tried to loop through each field and use |as_bootstrap, but it was returning error. This ment that I had to prepare the whole html structure of label + input + help + wrapping div with bootstrap classes to acheve bootstrap styling. I added id, name, label information using `field.`. 
```
          {% for field in traffic_msg_form %}
            <div class="mb-3">

                <label for="{{ field.id_for_label }}" class="form-label">{{ field.label }}</label>
                <input type="field.widget_type" class="form-control" id="{{ field.id_for_label }}" aria-describedby="{{ field.id_for_label }}-help" name="{{ field.html_name }}">
                
                <div id="{{ field.id_for_label }}-help" class="form-text">{{field.errors}}</div>

             </div>
          {% endfor %}
```
All this seemed to work and generated all fields that were needed by django model and set by forms.py, except of input type. The fields with text area or select input type just rendered as if the input type was set to text.

I tried to loop through each field, but the input type doesn't change. Django documentation about input type field ([here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.BoundField)) mentiones that field.widget_type should return the type of input.


django documentation provides example:
```
  {% for field in form %}
      {% if field.widget_type == 'checkbox' %}
          # render one way
      {% else %}
          # render another way
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
```
when I wrote `<input type="field.widget_type">` the page rendered with exactly the same `<input type="field.widget_type">`. It did not fill in the apropriate input type for each field. I might have to adjust forms.py to add widgets.

Even if the above works I would still have to loop throuogh options to display options in drop down. 

For now I decided to leave the forms |as_bootstraps - because they actualy work and display the content and input type correctly. This might need addressing in further development of the site.

### Unable to add "likes" to "cleared"
User is supposed to have possiblity to marked message as Road clear by clicking "cleared" icon on the traffic alert details view. The function returns error:

'ManyRelatedManager' object has no attribute 'cleared'

The cleared was created 

### requests==2.25.1

requests==2.25.1 was installed and returned error during instalation. Need to check if it affects app in any way. 
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
dj3-cloudinary-storage 0.0.6 requires requests>=2.26.0, but you have requests 2.25.1 which is incompatible.

### Link to Google Maps opens with no coordinates - resolved

when user sees the preview map, he can click bottom left corner "google" to be transferred to google app (on mobile) or google maps website (on desctop computer), unfortunately at the minute the google app/website opens with no coordinates.

@igor_ci
I used Crispy Forms in my MS4 and they worked nicely (except for a few HTML code validator errors that didnâ€™t affect display in any way).
But if you want to still use Django Bootstrap like in the videos, you need to
pip3 install django-forms-bootstrap
add "django_forms_bootstrap" to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
add the tag {% load bootstrap_tags %} to the top of every template you want to use Django Bootstrap forms in.
add the tag |as_bootstrap to every form you want to be styled with Django Bootstrap.

google maps API + javascript map API

Visits app is making API calls to get distance and lenght of the journey and displays a map. This was created by following tutorial [Python Django application walkthrough tutorial for Google maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCn8WND-JpU&t=8s) Bobby did coding. For more details the repository is located [here](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/did_django_google_maps_api).
