# Tank Mileage Tracker

[![showpiece](??? img location)](??? link to live website)

Click [here](???) to live site.  

## UX

The app aims to record daily mileage for each journey.

Workflow 1.
App can be used every day for each journey and the driver can save each route as they go. 
  - log in
  - go to "drive"
  - put in start and destination
  - be transfered to map preview page
  - add to database
  - click to go to maps (google maps on mobile or google maps website on desktop)
  - they arrive at destination
  - to go to next location, they need to go back to the Tank website (they would still be on map preview)
  - go back to "drive"
  - put in start and destinaton

This workflow requres too many steps - need to improve on this
This workflow requires the driver to juggle beetween google maps and Tank website and the work app that tells him the next address. 

This workflow makes sure that driver:
  - adds each journey to database (because he puts the address in Tank website instead of google maps) 
  - currently the driver needs to open work app - look up destination address and type postcode to google map.
  - with Tank website he needs to type the address and it allows him quickly to add the journey to database and get transfered to maps

Because the Tank website forces the user to regular use every day during the whole shift - it can be a good platform for:
  - trafficc messages
  - in work messages
  - tracking employer's progres in mileage reporting
  - advertising (if app is to be used commercialy)

Database:
  - each journey is saved as seperate position with start and destination saved with the distance.

Workflow 2
  - if drived didn't put in mileage for a particular day - needs to put in mileage in bulk

Workflow 3 
  - if driver has checked their daily report and realises he forgot to add one destination in the middle of the route. 



### User Stories

+ As a user, I would like to be able to â€¦



1.  the information to be clear and informative;
2.  the website be easy to navigate;


### Wireframes 

Wireframes created with Balsamiq. The project was developed from initial wireframes and some modifications were made during the development process to assure better usability. 

[Wireframes](???)

## Existing Features 

### Navbar and Footer

+ Navbar and footer has been copied from Bootstrap components and adjusted to the needs of the project
+ Navbar collapses into a hamburger button for easy navigation on mobile devices.
+ 

### Home page 

Traffic alert design - I've chosen a simple card design from bootstrap. I have also chosen to stack up the cards for larger screens to see two beside each other.
Since this is an app for driver I have taken the mobile first aproach. This app needs to be comfortable to use by someone that is using mobile phone only. This led to a decision to display only maximum of 4 messages per page. This way the mobile phone user will not have to scroll down too much, but there is an option to go to the next page.

## Project Bugs and Solutions:

### Problem with displaying form fields using |as_bootstrap

Forms with added |as_bootstrap display neatly on the page, unified with the style of the app. Unfortunately displaying form|as_bootstrap causes that fields display without proper gap between each line. The fields stick too close one above another. The label is nearly touching the field above. 

First tried to loop through each field and use |as_bootstrap, but it was returning error. This ment that I had to prepare the whole html structure of label + input + help + wrapping div with bootstrap classes to acheve bootstrap styling. I added id, name, label information using `field.`. 
```
          {% for field in traffic_msg_form %}
            <div class="mb-3">

                <label for="{{ field.id_for_label }}" class="form-label">{{ field.label }}</label>
                <input type="field.widget_type" class="form-control" id="{{ field.id_for_label }}" aria-describedby="{{ field.id_for_label }}-help" name="{{ field.html_name }}">
                
                <div id="{{ field.id_for_label }}-help" class="form-text">{{field.errors}}</div>

             </div>
          {% endfor %}
```
All this seemed to work and generated all fields that were needed by django model and set by forms.py, except of input type. The fields with text area or select input type just rendered as if the input type was set to text.

I tried to loop through each field, but the input type doesn't change. Django documentation about input type field ([here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/forms/api/#django.forms.BoundField)) mentiones that field.widget_type should return the type of input.


django documentation provides example:
```
  {% for field in form %}
      {% if field.widget_type == 'checkbox' %}
          # render one way
      {% else %}
          # render another way
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
```
when I wrote `<input type="field.widget_type">` the page rendered with exactly the same `<input type="field.widget_type">`. It did not fill in the apropriate input type for each field. I might have to adjust forms.py to add widgets.

Even if the above works I would still have to loop throuogh options to display options in drop down. 

For now I decided to leave the forms |as_bootstraps - because they actualy work and display the content and input type correctly. This might need addressing in further development of the site.

### Unable to add "likes" to "cleared"
User is supposed to have possiblity to marked message as Road clear by clicking "cleared" icon on the traffic alert details view. The function returns error:

'ManyRelatedManager' object has no attribute 'cleared'

The cleared was created 

### requests==2.25.1

requests==2.25.1 was installed and returned error during instalation. Need to check if it affects app in any way. 
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
dj3-cloudinary-storage 0.0.6 requires requests>=2.26.0, but you have requests 2.25.1 which is incompatible.

### Link to Google Maps opens with no coordinates - resolved

when user sees the preview map, he can click bottom left corner "google" to be transferred to google app (on mobile) or google maps website (on desctop computer), unfortunately at the minute the google app/website opens with no coordinates.

example url

https://www.google.com/maps/place/47%C2%B035'42.6%22N+122%C2%B019'53.9%22W/@47.5951518,-122.3316393,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xca3d37fe916595c3!8m2!3d47.5951518!4d-122.3316393

this url opens directions

the final api consists of those elements:
```

&origin=
latitute
%2C
longtitute
&destination=
latitute
%2C
longtitute
```
working example:

### Form on map.html not saving data

I created form to save data to create instance of Journey model.
1. I tried to add data using '<input type="hidden">' but the data wasn't being saved in the form, the view didn't recognize the manualy typed input fields as actual form and wasn't taking the data of those input fields.
2. I tried to pass arguments in urls, but I strugled to find the right format to pass more than one argument. After reading the documentation I found solution [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/#including-other-urlconfs), example that was given was passing multiple arguments using regular expession. Next step was to write correct expression to send the variables from form to view. I used [this](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/http/urls/#examples) example as guidance.
3. I was able to pass 3 arguments in url. If I tried to add 4th (latitute), I had error return URL not found and the url did not contain data. I wasn't able to establish the reason for this error.
4. I tried to get the latitute from map_view - latitute and longtitute are loaded on map view to URL, but I could not find the way to pass the arguments from get to post function (from map_view to add_visit)
5. I came to the conclusion that the latitude and longditute are not essential for user to have, as they are unreadable long number. The user will be needing full address and postcode. I have decided not to post data for latitute and longditute for now. 

### Problem with static files not loading on deployed site

Page was displaying white without any css or js files loaded. 

![deployed site without static files rendering correctly](static/img/readme/static1.png)


The below error was displaying on console:

![error message on the console](static/img/readme/static2.png)

Tried several solutions:

Not worked:

- import mimetypes - solution found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35557129/css-not-loading-wrong-mime-type-django) 
- changes to file path in settings and / or in base.html file, which was suggested in one of the answeres [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48248832/stylesheet-not-loaded-because-of-mime-type)

- assumption that the problem is caused by CSS library starting with comments - solution found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48248832/stylesheet-not-loaded-because-of-mime-type)

Worked:

- change `DEBUG = False` - solution found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35557129/css-not-loading-wrong-mime-type-django).

- make DEBUG variable dependable on development variable. If app can find development variable in enviroment - it sets the debug to the value of the variable, if no development variable found - the debug goes to False as default. Solution proposed in [this](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+FST101+2021_T1/courseware/dc049b343a9b474f8d75822c5fda1582/00bc94313a374f519dbec8dfb7ed0fbd/) Code Institute video. 
```
development = os.environ.get('DEVELOPMENT', False)

DEBUG = development

if development:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '127.0.0.1:8000']
else:
    ALLOWED_HOSTS = ["mileage-tracker-app.herokuapp.com"]
```
`os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"` variable needs to be added to env.py file, while in heroku - do not add this variable at all. 

### Problem with styling the map.html template

The google javascript api map requires special setting on the body and element that will hold the map:
```
#map-route {
height: 100%;
```

Unfortunately once the bootstrap css have been applied, this setting was not correct for page to render the map. I have tried to add `!important` but this has not worked. I tried all settings that were working from oryginal map-only.css and set them all as `!important` but this has not worked either. I could see on the developer's tools that map's div was rendering, but the div size was 0px hight. I tried various different settings in dev tools in chrome but none gave right scale of the map. I wasn't able to locate which part of bootstrap's styling needs to be overriden.

In the end I decided to style this page similarly as bootstrap looks - same background color and fonts. I have also styled javascript map in night mode to blend into the overall style of the app. 

### Hero image wondering to the left on the smaller screen sizes

I've noticed when testing responsivness on chrome dev tools that hero image on index.html is moving to the left of the screen, doesn't stay in the middle. I have tested in dev tools various different bootstrap classes and different css properties. The solution was adding some more classes in row div to control the number of columns depending on the screen size (`row row-cols-1 row-cols-sm-1 row-cols-md-1 row-cols-lg-2`), while the col divs will have only `col` class. Previously img div had set col width depending on screen size, while text col div had only settings for large screens. They did not seem to add up to 12 as per bootstrap's standard. I copied the classes from dev tools to the template, which has resolved the issue.

### Road cleared column of the TrafficMessage model

- the number of road cleared has not been displaying on the messages list view - found error in spelling, which has resolved the issue
- the view that was supposed to submit the `cleared` to the database was returning various different errors. I found missing `filter` method in the view
- number of Thanks wasn't increasing after the button to thank was clicked. I found that closing tag for form was missing.


### User unable to reaserch places using UK postcode

Drivers in UK are using postcodes (combination of letters and numbers) to get to next location. In uk postcode area is relatively small and google maps takes you ony a few doors down from the right address. It is much quicker to input postccode than type number, road and town.

Initial function that I found at Bobby did Coding has been using full address. After reading extensive documentation I have found out that I only need to replace the word "address" with "postal code". 

The function started getting the longtitude and latitude of the given postcode, but I've lost autocomplete. I added the "postal code" as a second argument together with address and now user has ability to input full address and use drop down box or postal code. 

Right now user has to click into the field and press enter. This will not work right on the mobile. 

This article [about](https://atomizedobjects.com/blog/javascript/how-to-get-postcodes-from-google-places-and-google-maps/) has helped me understand what sort of data I am getting from google places API. Google documentation can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/supported_types#table3) that describes exactly what types I can get. 

## Deployment

 The site was deployed to Heroku pages. 
 
 * The steps to deploy are as follows: 

 ??? need to update this to explain heroku steps

 plus install requirements txt
 plus obtain google api key

I used Crispy Forms in my MS4 and they worked nicely (except for a few HTML code validator errors that didnâ€™t affect display in any way).
But if you want to still use Django Bootstrap like in the videos, you need to
pip3 install django-forms-bootstrap
add "django_forms_bootstrap" to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py
add the tag {% load bootstrap_tags %} to the top of every template you want to use Django Bootstrap forms in.
add the tag |as_bootstrap to every form you want to be styled with Django Bootstrap.

google maps API + javascript map API

Visits app is making API calls to get distance and lenght of the journey and displays a map. This was created by following tutorial [Python Django application walkthrough tutorial for Google maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCn8WND-JpU&t=8s) Bobby did coding. For more details the repository is located [here](https://github.com/bobby-didcoding/did_django_google_maps_api).
