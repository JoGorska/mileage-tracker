[Wireframes](???)

## Existing Features 

### Navbar and Footer

+ Navbar and footer has been copied from Bootstrap components and adjusted to the needs of the project
+ Navbar collapses into a hamburger button for easy navigation on mobile devices.
+ 

### Home page 

Traffic alert design - I've chosen a simple card design from bootstrap. I have also chosen to stack up the cards for larger screens to see two beside each other.
Since this is an app for driver I have taken the mobile first aproach. This app needs to be comfortable to use by someone that is using mobile phone only. This led to a decision to display only maximum of 4 messages per page. This way the mobile phone user will not have to scroll down too much, but there is an option to go to the next page.
